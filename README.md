# Accountability: Your Binary Accountabilibuddy!

Simply check in with Accountability to keep yourself on track!  If you're having trouble (hey, it happens!), Your buddy will send you a gentle email reminder.  If you fear you may miss that one, you'll have the opportunity to set a real life Accountability Buddy in the system who will get an email after consecutive misses.

Built on Flask/Python 3/Bootstrap/some database I haven't picked yet.  Probably SQLite or Postgres

##Requirements/Dependencies
* Python 3
* The ability to pip install things (see the requirements.txt)
* A web server (or localhost if you want to just run it locally)

##Setup:
* Clone the Repo
* Create a new Python3 Virtualenv (or use your global python3 if you're feeling reckless - venv is the only supported configuration)
* venv/bin/pip3 install -r requirements.txt
* Edit secrets.py with your own keys.  Use of the defaults (especially in prod) is at your own risk.
